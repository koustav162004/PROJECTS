Overview: Exploring olympic data using SQL
The Olympics symbolize global unity and athletic excellence, with a wealth of data on athletes,
events, and trends. Leveraging this data through SQL (Structured Query Language) provides
a powerful tool for analysis, insight generation, and decision-making.
The SQL case study on the Olympics aims to uncover insights using SQL queries. It explores
various aspects, including the total number of Olympic games, nations' participation, trends
over time, and notable achievements like top athletes and oldest medallists. Additionally, it
examines sports played maximum time, and India's hockey performance. Through SQL
analysis, the project aims to provide concise insights into the rich Olympic dataset.
